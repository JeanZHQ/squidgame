        The function should return a tuple of (x,y) coordinates to which the player moves.

        It should be the result of the ExpectiMinimax algorithm, maximizing over the Opponent's *Trap* actions, 
        taking into account the probabilities of them landing in the positions you believe they'd throw to.

        Note that you are not required to account for the probabilities of it landing in a different cell.

        You may adjust the input variables as you wish (though it is not necessary). Output has to be (x,y) coordinates.
